            <h1>Our Commitment</h1>     
            <p>When the Apostle Paul wrote the words of 2 Timothy 2:2, he challenged Timothy to continue the task of theological training which was begun in him by teaching reliable people who would also teach others. Paul knew that training of church leaders would be a never-ending process. The Baptist Theological Seminary of Zambia (BTSZ) has accepted the challenge to continue the task of teaching those who would teach others.</p>
            <p>We have been a training center for Pastors and Church Leaders in Zambia for over 50 years. Through programs saturated with "Biblical Preaching, Contextual Teaching, and Bold Witnessing," we are equipping men and women to faithfully serve in Jesus' Name, entrusting the Scriptures to others!</p>

            <h1>Ownership</h1>     
            <p>The Baptist Theological Seminary of Zambia is a theological training institution owned and funded by the Baptist Fellowship of Zambia (a Baptist denomination of approximately 2000 Zambian churches) and operated in partnership with the Baptist Mission of Zambia (an organization supported through the International Mission Board, USA). While the main concern of theological training is for students from the churches of the Baptist Fellowship of Zambia, the Seminary also welcomes students from other Christian denominations and from other countries.</p>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The Baptist Theological Seminary of Zambia was established in January 1967. Classes began with five men and four women. The first classes of the school were held at the BaptistBuilding near downtown Lusaka on the Great East Road. The first graduation was held in 1972 with 10 students being graduated. The graduation speaker for the first graduation ceremony was His Excellency, Dr. Kenneth D. Kaunda, president of the Republic of Zambia. Now, the BTSZ boasts hundreds of graduates - many who serve in churches throughout Zambia and some who have studied further in places like South Africa, Kenya, South Korea, and the United States. </p>
            <h1>Accreditation</h1>
            <p>The Baptist Theological Seminary is internationally affiliated with the Accrediting Council for Theological Education in Africa (ACTEA) and maintains the highest academic standards. The Seminary is also seeking recognition through the Zambian Higher Education Administration (HEA).</p>
